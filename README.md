# Mycoflora

This game is a small open world ARPG with a flower-based magic system. The world is littered with flowers that can be spent to cast spells in combat.

This world doesn't draw a distinction between flowers and mushrooms they are the same magical material called Mycoflora.

## Goal

The main goal is to create a small world with a main quest and some side quests and side content to explore, then expand from there.
