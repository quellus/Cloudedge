The plan for this project is to make a large open world ARPG full of side quests, unique encounters, and a main storyline.

The game centers around a flower-based magic system where flowers collected throughout exploration are used as as ammo for spells or can be condsumed to tune spells to your playstyle.

The goal right now is to develop the beggining of the main story where the main character is forced to fight via melee combat, begins to uncover the main conflict of the story, and learns how to cast spells for the first time.
